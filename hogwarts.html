            <p>The Hogwarts Student List is an individual project from school, in which I learned more about string methods, array methods, filtering and sorting and conditional logic.
            <p> The assignment was to create some sort of a system, that would facilitate going through a list of student.</p>
            <br>We were given two Json files that contained the names of all the students and the houses that they belong to, together with a ZIP file with almost all the student pictures.

            The requirements were to clean the data, add some functionalities that would let the user expel students, make them prefect, add them to the inquisitorial squad and hack the system. 
             </p>

    <div class="about-project-text2">
        <p>The first component of my code is the one that loads the json file and cleans the data. I have created three functions for this part, one that loads the data, another one that maps the objects and the other one that creates the student object and cleans it.</p>
        <p>The second component of my code has the role of sorting and filtering the student list, by name, blood, house and status. For this part I have created several functions, used global arrays and object properties in order to obtain a curated lists of students.
            </p>
            <p>Another component of my code is the one where I set different conditions for choosing the Inquisitorial Squad Members. Based on the properties: house and blood, I have created a function that allows the user to select the members for the Inquisitorial squad, according with the requirements of the assignments.

    <p>The last part of this assignment implied to create a "hack the system" function that makes three things happening. 
        Once the user clicks the "Hack the system" button, my name is injected into the list of student and makes it not possible to expel me. Secondly, the blood status algorithm is randomized and no longer thrustworthy. Lastly, adding a student to the inquisitorial squad works only for a limited time.</p>
